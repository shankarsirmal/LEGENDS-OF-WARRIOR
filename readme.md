# ⚔️ LEGEND OF WARRIOR

**LEGEND OF WARRIOR** is a small 2D fighting game made using **Python** and **Pygame** for my college mini project.  
In this game, a brave **warrior** fights against different **monsters** using his sword, arrows, and fireballs.  
There are 3 levels in total, and each level has new characters and a new background.

## 🎯 **Game Story**

You are a **legendary warrior** who must defeat monsters that appear in each stage.  
Each time you win, you move to the next level, facing a stronger enemy.  
If your health goes to zero, the game ends.  
If you defeat all 3 monsters, you win the game!
